# Code First Girls: Introduction to Data and SQL Course
I undertook this course run by Code First Girls during Winter 2023. This course is an 8 week introductory course and was my first experience of databases and SQL. We used MySQL Workbench throughout the course and learned:

database creation, structure and management
basic queries
queries with conditions, group by, having
subqueries
joins and the union operator
transactions
views
stored functions
stored procedures
events
triggers
backups

## Final Project
This repository contains my final project which was a requirement of the course. 

It is a database that contains details of a made-up Etsy plant store. The ([plants.sql](https://github.com/Carolina-Toste/CFG_Data_and_SQL/blob/main/plants.sql)) script contains the code used to create and populate the tables and the task.sql script contains the code used to complete the various requirements of the project such as creating views (including complex views) , creating stored functions, creating stored procedures, subqueries, creating events, triggers, etc.. The repository also contains a backup of the database
